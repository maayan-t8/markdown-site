### Regulatory Context

**CMS Acute Hospital Care at Home Waiver**: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services launched the Acute Hospital Care at Home waiver program in November 2020, providing Medicare reimbursement for hospital-at-home services during the public health emergency. The waiver has been extended multiple times, with the most recent extension through 2024/2025 [2023-12-15](https://contessahealth.com/why-2023-was-a-milestone-year/), [2025-01-10](https://contessahealth.com/comprehensive-care-at-home-in-2025-and-beyond/)

Contessa's model is designed to operate both with and without the waiver, utilizing risk-based contracts that don't solely depend on Medicare fee-for-service reimbursement [2023-12-15](https://contessahealth.com/why-2023-was-a-milestone-year/)

## 10. Risk Factors & Concerns

### Documented Concerns

1. **Regulatory Dependency**: Hospital-at-home reimbursement significantly depends on CMS Acute Hospital Care at Home waiver continuation. While Contessa's model is designed to operate with risk-based contracts independent of the waiver, uncertainty around waiver extension creates market risk [2023-12-15](https://contessahealth.com/why-2023-was-a-milestone-year/)

2. **Near-Term Financial Drag**: Contessa reported as a near-term drag on Amedisys financials post-acquisition, indicating investment phase before profitability [2023-04-11](https://homehealthcarenews.com/2023/04/contessa-health-co-founder-and-ceo-travis-messina-leaves-company-after-8-years/)

3. **Founder Departure**: Co-founder and CEO Travis Messina departed in April 2023 after 8 years, which may impact institutional knowledge and strategic direction [2023-04-11](https://homehealthcarenews.com/2023/04/contessa-health-co-founder-and-ceo-travis-messina-leaves-company-after-8-years/)

4. **Staffing Challenges**: Industry-wide nursing shortage affects ability to staff hospital-at-home programs, though Contessa reports mitigation through Amedisys resources and 2% nursing turnover [2022-10-05](https://contessahealth.com/how-contessa-solves-key-issues/)

5. **Parent Company Uncertainty**: Amedisys has been subject to acquisition interest from UnitedHealth/Optum and Option Care Health, creating uncertainty about Contessa's long-term ownership structure [2023-06-07](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/providers/option-care-health-ceo-john-rademacher-amedisys-optum-unitedhealth-group/)
