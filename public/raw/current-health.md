Current Health expanded from the UK to the US market following FDA 510(k) clearance in 2019, establishing partnerships with major health systems and pharmaceutical companies.

### Best Buy Era (2021-2025)

During the Best Buy ownership period, Current Health was integrated into Best Buy Health alongside other acquisitions including GreatCall/Lively (senior care) [2025-06-25](https://homehealthcarenews.com/2025/06/best-buy-sells-current-health-back-to-co-founder-former-ceo/). Best Buy's strategy involved leveraging Geek Squad logistics for device installation and support, retail scale, and service capabilities.

Best Buy faced challenges scaling the healthcare business, ultimately incurring $109M in restructuring charges and divesting Current Health [2025-06-30](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/whats-next-current-health-after-best-buy-divests-care-home-company).

### Return to Independence (June 2025)

Christopher McGhee's statement on LinkedIn upon reacquisition: "I came back to build Current Health into a globally significant company. We have so much to do, and the story is not finished. The future of healthcare is in the home and the community, and we have a role to play in that transformation." [2025-06-26](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/former-current-health-ceo-buys-back-company-best-buy)

He also noted the company would have "a return to scrappiness and that startup spirit, rolling up our sleeves and moving quickly, with patient safety and customer experience at the center." [2025-06-26](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/former-current-health-ceo-buys-back-company-best-buy)

## 9. Risk Factors & Considerations

### Documented Considerations

1. **Regulatory Dependency**: Hospital-at-home programs in the US operate under CMS Acute Hospital Care at Home (AHCaH) waiver, which was set to expire in late 2024 and requires ongoing renewal [2024-02-27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01040-9)

2. **Ownership Transition**: Company has undergone significant ownership changes (acquisition by Best Buy 2021, divestiture 2025), which may impact customer relationships and operational continuity

3. **Best Buy Restructuring**: Parent company incurred $109M in restructuring charges related to health business [2025-06-25](https://www.hmenews.com/article/current-health-no-longer-part-of-best-buy)

4. **Market Nascency**: Hospital-at-home market is still developing with ongoing debates about reimbursement, quality standards, and scalability [2024-02-27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01040-9)

5. **Competitive Pressure**: Multiple well-funded competitors in RPM and hospital-at-home space
