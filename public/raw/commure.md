### Company Description

Commure is an enterprise AI-powered healthcare technology company that provides next-generation infrastructure for health systems. The company was incubated by General Catalyst in 2017 and launched commercially in 2020. Commure positions itself as a "healthcare operating system" built on CommureOS, a unified platform that integrates ambient intelligence, agentic AI, and revenue cycle automation [2024-10-23](https://www.commure.com/press-releases/hca-and-commure-announce-largest-ai-deployment-in-healthcare).

The company's approach centers on "radical collaboration" between technologists and healthcare leaders, using a Forward Deployed Engineering (FDE) model where engineers embed directly with clinical and operational teams to co-develop solutions [2024-12-30](https://www.commure.com/blog/commure-growth-explodes-in-2024-powering-ai-and-sensors-for-250k-providers-transforming-healthcare-delivery). This model has enabled rapid iteration and customization for major health systems.

In October 2023, Commure merged with Athelas, another General Catalyst-backed healthcare technology company, creating a combined entity valued at $6B [2023-10-04](https://www.athelas.com/tbh/athelas-commure-merging-to-create-a-6b-healthcare-infrastructure-company). The merger brought together Commure's enterprise software focus serving large health systems (HCA Healthcare, Providence, Jefferson, VA) with Athelas's rapid product velocity and revenue cycle expertise. The combined company retained the Commure name with Athelas co-founder Tanay Tandon as CEO.

Since the merger, Commure has pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy, acquiring ambient AI pioneer Augmedix for $139M in July 2024 [2024-07-19](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/ai-and-machine-learning/augmedix-acquired-commure-valuation-139-mil) and digital care navigation platform Memora Health in December 2024 [2024-12-20](https://www.commure.com/press-releases/commure-acquires-memora-health-to-enhance-intelligent-care-navigation). These acquisitions have expanded Commure's product portfolio and strengthened its position in the ambient AI documentation market.

Commure's platform now integrates with over 60 EHRs and powers millions of encounters, hundreds of millions of patient interactions, and tens of billions of dollars in annual claims [2024-12-30](https://www.commure.com/blog/commure-growth-explodes-in-2024-powering-ai-and-sensors-for-250k-providers-transforming-healthcare-delivery).
