## The Problem They Solve

### The $62 Billion Readmission Crisis

- **1 in 5 patients** face readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge
- The post-discharge period is the most vulnerable time for patients
- Traditional care models leave a dangerous gap between hospital and primary care
- Patients often have unanswered questions, medication concerns, and developing complications with no immediate resource

### Historical Context

Before 1996, primary care physicians managed hospitalized patients. The rise of hospitalists created efficiency gains but inadvertently created a significant care void after discharge. Patients are discharged quickly, often without adequate follow-up systems in place, leading to preventable readmissions, ER visits, and adverse outcomes.

## The Solution: Transitional Care Medicine

### The Transitionist® Model

Dimer Health has created a new clinical specialty: the **Transitionist**—a physician or advanced practice provider specializing in the immediate post-discharge period.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Virtual visits within 24-72 hours post-discharge
- 24/7 availability for patient concerns
- Proactive outreach (they contact patients, not vice versa)
- Technology-enabled care delivery
- Bridges the gap until patients reconnect with primary/specialty care

**Differentiation from Traditional Models:**
| Traditional Care | Transitionist Model |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Patient-initiated contact | Proactive provider outreach |
| Business hours availability | 24/7 access |
| Wait for PCP appointment | Same-day virtual visits |
| Care gaps post-discharge | Continuous monitoring |
| Reactive intervention | Predictive risk assessment |
