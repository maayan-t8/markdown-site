### Company Description

Counsel Health is a full-stack, AI-native medical group that combines advanced medical AI with board-certified physicians to deliver immediate, personalized medical guidance through an asynchronous, messaging-based platform [2025-10-16](https://a16z.com/announcement/investing-in-counsel-health/). The company was founded in late 2023 with the observation that most of healthcare's problems stem from a massive mismatch between supply and demand - in many parts of the U.S., it takes more than 30 days to see a primary care doctor [2025-10-23](https://www.counselhealth.com/blog/how-we-got-here-the-story-behind-our-series-a).

The company operates as a licensed medical provider, enabling it to provide real clinical action including prescriptions, lab tests, referrals, and follow-ups - not just information [2025-10-16](https://a16z.com/announcement/investing-in-counsel-health/). Through its messaging-based platform, members can start a visit anytime and receive care within minutes from a combination of medical-grade AI and real, board-certified doctors.

A key innovation is Counsel's AI-powered "clinician cockpit" that allows a single physician to safely care for more than 25,000 patients, compared to the traditional primary care model where a doctor can manage around 1,500 patients [2025-10-23](https://www.counselhealth.com/blog/how-we-got-here-the-story-behind-our-series-a). The company describes this as building an "Ironman suit for doctors" that serves as a superhuman support system for physicians [2025-02-25](https://a16z.com/podcast/an-ironman-suit-for-doctors-with-muthu-alagappan/).

Counsel Health operates as an in-house medical group licensed in most U.S. states (available in all states except Arkansas, District of Columbia, Kansas, Mississippi, Rhode Island, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin) [Accessed 2026-01-03](https://www.counselhealth.com/).
