## 10. Risk Factors & Concerns

### Documented Concerns

**Leadership Transition**: CEO Robert Sepucha departed September 2025 after three years leading the company. New CEO Tommy O'Connor appointed October 2025, representing significant leadership change [2025-09-18](https://freseniusmedicalcare.com/en/media/newsroom/fresenius-medical-care-advances-its-fme-reignite-strategy-by-increasing-ownership-in-its-value-based-care-asset-and-appointing-a-new-leader-for-the-operating-segment/).

**Ownership Concentration**: Fresenius Medical Care's increased ownership stake (September 2025) means reduced independence. The company operates as a subsidiary of a large public company, which may limit strategic flexibility [2025-09-18](https://freseniusmedicalcare.com/en/media/newsroom/fresenius-medical-care-advances-its-fme-reignite-strategy-by-increasing-ownership-in-its-value-based-care-asset-and-appointing-a-new-leader-for-the-operating-segment/).

**Employee Sentiment**: Glassdoor rating of 3.3/5 indicates mixed employee satisfaction. Some reviews mention layoffs in 2023 [Accessed 2025-01-02](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/InterWell-Health-Reviews-E7905036.htm).

**Competitive Market**: Facing well-funded competitors including Strive Health ($550M raised, $1.8B valuation) and Monogram Health ($375M raised) [2025-09-09](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/health-tech/mh-strive-health-funding-nea-hercules-cvs/).

**Regulatory Dependence**: Heavily dependent on CMS value-based care programs (Kidney Care Choices) which are subject to policy changes.
