### Company Description

Somatus was founded in 2016 to reshape an industry that has traditionally focused on the provision of dialysis for those who have already experienced kidney failure. The company introduced value-based kidney care as an alternative approach, emphasizing prevention, early detection, and whole-person care rather than reactive treatment [2022-02-23](https://somatus.com/inthenews/somatus-raises-325m-to-deliver-proven-value-based-kidney-care-model-to-more-americans-with-kidney-disease/).

The company's model focuses on actively partnering with locally-based providers and bringing personalized, in-home care and support directly to patients with kidney disease. Through the use of its proprietary RenalIQ technology platform, multi-disciplinary community-based care teams, and partnerships with nephrologists and primary care physicians, Somatus has built a model focused on prevention and awareness that empowers all people with kidney disease to take control of their health [2022-02-23](https://somatus.com/inthenews/somatus-raises-325m-to-deliver-proven-value-based-kidney-care-model-to-more-americans-with-kidney-disease/).

More than 37.5 million Americans have chronic kidney disease, with the majority not knowing they have it or the rapid pace at which it can progress. Somatus addresses this market need by focusing on early identification and intervention [2022-02-23](https://somatus.com/inthenews/somatus-raises-325m-to-deliver-proven-value-based-kidney-care-model-to-more-americans-with-kidney-disease/).

In addition to kidney care, Somatus has expanded to offer congestive heart failure (CHF) management services for health plan partners, leveraging its proven track record in managing patients with chronic conditions [Accessed 2025-01-02](https://somatus.com/health-plans/).

### Company Values

Somatus has defined five core values that guide their operations [Accessed 2025-01-02](https://somatus.com/team/):

1. **Authenticity**: "We believe in real dialogue. In any interaction, with patients, partners, vendors, or our teammates, we are true to who we are, say what we mean, and mean what we say."

2. **Collaboration**: "If you want to run fast, run alone; if you want to run far, run together."

3. **Empowerment**: "We make sure every voice gets heard and all ideas are considered, especially when it comes to our patients' lives or our partners' best interests."

4. **Innovation**: "We were founded on the belief that the entire kidney care industry needed to change. That's why we relentlessly look for ways to improve upon the status quo."

5. **Tenacity**: "We don't shy away from hard problems. We lean into them because we know our patients, partners, and communities deserve better."

## 11. Risk Factors & Concerns

### Documented Considerations

**Market Competition**: The value-based kidney care market is becoming increasingly competitive with well-funded competitors including Strive Health (recently raised $550M at $1.8B valuation) and Interwell Health (formed from $2.4B merger) [Factual observation based on market data].

**Regulatory Dependency**: The company's growth has been enabled by CMS value-based care programs and regulations. Changes to Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement policies could impact the business model [Factual industry context].

**Credit Risk Assessment**: Martini.ai reports Somatus holds a B4 rating with a probability of default value of 0.479%, reflecting a moderate level of credit risk. The company's risk profile has been noted as deteriorating, with credit spread widening [Accessed 2025-01-02](https://martini.ai/pages/research/Somatus-8435fad1c3f7de8a755172621b4b36e4) [Third-party assessment].

### No Major Concerns Found
