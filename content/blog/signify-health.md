### Company Description

Signify Health is a technology-enabled healthcare services company that partners with health plans, healthcare providers, and technology companies to improve quality of life by providing comprehensive care where and when it is needed most. The company operates a healthcare platform that combines advanced analytics, proprietary technology, and a nationwide network of clinicians to deliver value-based care programs [2018-07-18](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/censeohealth-and-advance-health-to-become-signify-health-300682701.html).

The company's core strength lies in its ability to deploy physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants into home and facility settings to close gaps in care and documentation for high-risk patients. This increases data accuracy and engages health plan members in ongoing care in their place of residence [Accessed 2026-01-03](https://www.newmountaincapital.com/portfolio/signify-health/).
