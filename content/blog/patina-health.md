### Company Description

Patina Health was a senior-focused primary care company that reimagined healthcare delivery for adults 65 and older. The company provided virtual and in-home primary care services through dedicated care teams that included primary care physicians, "health champions" (care coordinators), behavioral health specialists, and other clinical resources [2021-10-26](https://homehealthcarenews.com/2021/10/home-focused-primary-care-startup-patina-health-raises-57m/).

The company's model was designed as an alternative to traditional fee-for-service primary care, instead operating as a value-based care provider contracted with Medicare Advantage plans. Patina distinguished itself through relationship-centered care, extended appointment times, 24/7 access to care teams via app and phone, and the convenience of receiving care at home rather than in clinical offices [2022-07-11](https://technical.ly/startups/patina-jack-stoddard-accolade/).

Patina operated through a dual-entity structure: Patina Medical Groups provided clinical services to Medicare beneficiaries, while Patina Health, Inc. provided administrative and management services including technology, population health analytics, and operational support [2024-01-04](https://www.prweb.com/releases/patina-and-humana-team-to-deliver-convenient-relationship-centered-primary-care-to-medicare-advantage-members-in-the-charlotte-region-302025897.html).

In March 2025, just months before closure, Patina launched "Patina Total Health," a population health service designed to serve Medicare Advantage members at scale without requiring them to change primary care providers [2025-03-18](https://www.prweb.com/releases/patina-launches-new-service-patina-total-health-tm-to-make-personalized-age-friendly-care-accessible-to-medicare-advantage-members-302404188.html).

> "Dear Patina Total Health Patients,
>
> After great effort and consideration, Patina has made the difficult decision to close our practice due to unforeseen business challenges. It has been a great honor to be part of your health and aging journey, and we are committed to helping you through a transition in care before we close."

## 11. Risk Factors & Post-Mortem Analysis

### Documented Factors Contributing to Closure

1. **"Unforeseen business challenges"** - Company's official stated reason [Accessed 2026-01-02](https://patinahealth.com/)

### Potential Contributing Factors (Inferred from Industry Context)

- **Value-based care economics**: Difficulty achieving profitability in Medicare Advantage risk-sharing arrangements
- **Patient acquisition costs**: High cost of acquiring and retaining patients in fragmented MA market
- **Geographic expansion**: Expansion to Charlotte region may have stretched resources
- **Competitive pressure**: Market dominated by well-funded competitors (Oak Street/CVS, One Medical/Amazon)
- **MA plan economics**: 2024-2025 saw significant Medicare Advantage plan profitability pressures affecting partner economics
- **Capital requirements**: May have needed additional funding that was not secured

### Industry Context

The senior-focused primary care market saw significant consolidation during Patina's operational period:
- Oak Street Health acquired by CVS Health (2023)
- Iora Health acquired by One Medical, then Amazon acquired One Medical (2023)
- Significant venture capital pullback in healthcare during 2022-2024
