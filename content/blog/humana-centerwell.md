### Company Description

CenterWell represents Humana's strategic investment in vertical integration of healthcare services, bringing together primary care, home health, and pharmacy services under a unified brand. The division was created to serve as a "payer-agnostic" healthcare services platform, meaning it accepts patients regardless of their insurance provider, though it maintains strong integration with Humana's Medicare Advantage plans [2021-03-16](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-introduces-centerwell-new-brand-range-its-payer-agnostic).

The company operates through three primary business lines:
1. **CenterWell Senior Primary Care** - Senior-focused primary care clinics
2. **CenterWell Home Health** - Home-based healthcare services (formerly Kindred at Home)
3. **CenterWell Pharmacy** - Mail-order and specialty pharmacy services (formerly Humana Pharmacy)

Additionally, **Conviva Senior Primary Care** operates as an affiliated brand primarily serving Florida and Texas markets, maintaining its separate identity while being part of Humana's Primary Care Organization [Accessed 2025-01-02](https://www.convivacarecenters.com).

The strategic rationale behind CenterWell is to create an integrated care delivery model that can improve health outcomes for seniors while reducing overall healthcare costs - a critical capability in the value-based care environment that dominates Medicare Advantage [2023-05](https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/perspectives/health/2023/may/humanas-centerwell-aims-to-unify-senior-care-under-one-roof.html).
