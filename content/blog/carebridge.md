### Company Description

CareBridge is a value-based healthcare company that partners with managed Medicaid and Medicare plans to care for individuals receiving home and community-based services (HCBS). The company was formed through the acquisition of two existing LTSS technology companies - HealthStar (a Knoxville-based electronic visit verification company) and Sinq Technologies (a Chicago-based data aggregation and value-based payment company) [2020-01-13](https://www.carebridgehealth.com/news/launch-article).

The company exclusively serves Medicaid and dual-eligible patients who have physical or intellectual disabilities and are receiving home and community-based services. These patients represent approximately 3% of Medicaid patients but account for 17% of total Medicaid spending [2023-08-15](https://fcventures.com/americas-fastest-growing-company-is-tackling-the-greatest-challenge-in-health-care/).

CareBridge's business model centers on taking risk for the total cost and quality of care for patients, sharing savings with managed care organizations (MCOs) when care costs come in below baseline. The company deploys tablets to members' homes, enabling 24/7 access to an interdisciplinary clinical team including physicians, nurse practitioners, social workers, behavioral health specialists, and pharmacists [2022-06-08](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/carebridge-closes-140m-financing-to-expand-value-based-care-to-individuals-receiving-home-and-community-based-services-301563873.html).

CareBridge became the first healthcare company in a decade to rank #1 on the Inc. 5000 list of fastest-growing private companies in America in 2023, with revenue growing from approximately $555,000 to $873 million over a three-year period [2023-08-15](https://fcventures.com/americas-fastest-growing-company-is-tackling-the-greatest-challenge-in-health-care/).

## 10. Risk Factors & Concerns

### Documented Concerns

**Regulatory and Policy Risk**:
- CMS has proposed a rule requiring 80% of HCBS funds go to workers rather than profit, administration, and overhead. This could impact CareBridge's business model [2023-08-15](https://fcventures.com/americas-fastest-growing-company-is-tackling-the-greatest-challenge-in-health-care/).

**Labor Shortage Risk**:
- Healthcare companies face severe labor shortages of long-term care workers, which industry experts expect to intensify [2023-08-15](https://fcventures.com/americas-fastest-growing-company-is-tackling-the-greatest-challenge-in-health-care/).

**Concentration Risk**:
- Company's $2.5B in 2023 revenue came from only five major payer clients, indicating high customer concentration [2023-08-15](https://fcventures.com/americas-fastest-growing-company-is-tackling-the-greatest-challenge-in-health-care/).

**Political/Regulatory Exposure**:
- Co-founder Brad Smith's involvement in DOGE and HHS policy activities may create reputational or conflict-of-interest concerns. Media has noted the connection between his business interests and government advisory roles [2025-06-02](https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/02/brad-smith-doge-little-known-architect-67-billion-hhs-cuts/).

**Evaluation Concerns**:
- External analysts have called for "vigorous evaluation" of the model of transferring care from local providers to a national company [2023-08-15](https://fcventures.com/americas-fastest-growing-company-is-tackling-the-greatest-challenge-in-health-care/).

### Employee Count Discrepancy

- Conflicting data on employee count: 430+ reported in 2023 Inc. article vs. 274 in 2024 Exa data. This could indicate layoffs or data inaccuracy [Medium confidence].
