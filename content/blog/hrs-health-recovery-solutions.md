### Company Description

Health Recovery Solutions (HRS) is a healthcare technology company that provides comprehensive remote patient monitoring (RPM) and telehealth solutions to healthcare organizations across the care continuum. The company was founded in 2012 by three college friends - Jarrett Bauer, Rohan Udeshi, and Daniel Priece - in a one-bedroom apartment in New York City [Accessed 2026-01-02](https://www.juntohealth.org/blog-posts/founder-feature-health-recovery-solutions-hrs).

The company's founding was inspired by personal experience - Jarrett Bauer's grandmother was unnecessarily readmitted to the hospital for heart failure due to lack of proper post-discharge care [Accessed 2026-01-02](https://homehealthcarenews.com/2020/05/changemakers-ceo-and-co-founder-health-recovery-solutions/). This experience led Bauer to research the key drivers of hospital readmission: medication adherence, dietary adherence, lack of health literacy, and lack of caregiver support.

HRS partners with providers across the care continuum - including hospitals, health systems, home health agencies, community health centers, hospice and palliative care organizations, physician practices, and payers - to deliver solutions that improve coordination of care, achieve better outcomes, and reduce costs [Accessed 2026-01-02](https://www.healthrecoverysolutions.com/).

As of August 2024, HRS has impacted the lives of over 1 million patients and their caregivers, working with more than 400 U.S. and Canadian healthcare organizations across nearly 20 distinct care settings and supporting more than 100 clinical conditions [2024-08-07](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/health-recovery-solutions-surpasses-1-million-patient-lives-impacted-a-decade-of-telehealth-and-rpm-excellence-302215934.html).
