## 10. Risk Factors & Concerns

### Documented Concerns

**Funding Timeline**: Last funding round (Series B) was in December 2020 - over 4 years ago. No publicly announced funding since then. [Medium risk - company may be operating on existing capital or revenue, or may have raised undisclosed funding]

**Competitive Pressure**: Operates in highly competitive telehealth market with well-funded competitors including Amazon-owned One Medical, Teladoc, and others with significantly more capital [Accessed 2026-01-02](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/curai-health)

**Employee Count Discrepancy**: Tracxn reports 18 employees as of Dec 2022, while Apollo reports ~130. This discrepancy suggests data quality issues or significant changes not captured in public databases.

### No Significant Concerns Found

- No documented layoffs in research period
- No negative press coverage found
- No regulatory issues or legal proceedings identified
- Leadership team stable with strategic hire (COO) in October 2024
