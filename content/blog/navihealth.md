## Executive Summary

naviHealth is a post-acute care management company founded in 2012, now operating as part of Optum's Home & Community Care division within UnitedHealth Group. The company pioneered a technology-enabled approach to managing post-acute care transitions, combining predictive algorithms with clinical case management to optimize patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Following multiple ownership changes - from Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe to Cardinal Health to Clayton Dubilier & Rice - Optum acquired naviHealth in May 2020 for approximately $2.5 billion. The company has faced significant controversy over its nH Predict algorithm, which has been accused of inappropriately denying Medicare Advantage beneficiaries access to skilled nursing and rehabilitation care.

### Mission & Vision

**Original Mission**: To help health plans, health systems, and post-acute providers manage the continuum of post-acute care through evidence-based protocols and technology-enabled services [Accessed 2026-01-03](https://newsroom.cardinalhealth.com/company-news?item=123072)

**Company Vision**: Optimize post-acute care transitions to reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions, improve patient outcomes, and align stakeholder incentives under value-based care models.

### Company Description

naviHealth was founded in 2012 to address inefficiencies in post-acute care delivery within the U.S. healthcare system. The company emerged during the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which introduced bundled payments and value-based care models that incentivized reducing post-acute care costs while maintaining quality [2023-08-01](https://prospect.org/2023/08/01/2023-08-01-patient-zero-tom-scully/).

The company developed a "high tech, high touch" model combining proprietary predictive algorithms with local clinical case managers to guide patients through post-acute care settings including skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), long-term acute care hospitals (LTACHs), and home health services [2020-05-19](https://medcitynews.com/2020/05/navihealth-trades-hands-again-with-optum-acquisition/).

naviHealth's core value proposition to Medicare Advantage plans and health systems was risk assumption: the company would take responsibility for managing all post-acute care for 60-90 days following hospital discharge, sharing in any cost savings achieved [2023-08-01](https://prospect.org/2023/08/01/2023-08-01-patient-zero-tom-scully/). This model aligned incentives to minimize unnecessary skilled nursing facility stays while theoretically ensuring appropriate care transitions.

By 2020, naviHealth had grown to manage post-acute services for approximately 4.5 million Medicare Advantage members and partnered with nine of the top 10 health systems in the United States [2020-05-19](https://medcitynews.com/2020/05/navihealth-trades-hands-again-with-optum-acquisition/).
