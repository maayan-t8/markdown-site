## Executive Summary

Medically Home was a Boston-based healthcare technology company founded in 2017 that pioneered the hospital-at-home care delivery model, enabling health systems to provide acute hospital-level care to patients in their homes. The company developed a comprehensive platform combining clinical protocols, telemedicine command centers, remote monitoring technology, and logistics fulfillment to create a "virtual hospital" experience. Medically Home raised approximately $284 million from strategic healthcare investors including Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, Baxter International, Cardinal Health, and Global Medical Response. In June 2025, the company merged with DispatchHealth, creating one of the nation's largest hospital-at-home providers. The merger reportedly came amid financial struggles, with leaked documents suggesting significant valuation losses compared to the company's 2022 near-unicorn status.
