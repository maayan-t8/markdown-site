*Transaction Status: Closed*

---

## Deal Summary

PointClickCare, the dominant cloud-based EHR for the senior care industry, acquired Collective Medical, the leading real-time care coordination network, for $650 million. The acquisition created the largest combined acute and post-acute care network in North America, connecting hospitals, ambulatory practices, skilled nursing facilities, and health plans through real-time patient data sharing.

This transaction is highly relevant to Dimer Health as Collective Medical's core value proposition centered on enabling care coordination during transitions - providing real-time visibility into patient movements between hospitals, emergency departments, and post-acute settings to improve outcomes and reduce readmissions.

## Exit Scenario Analysis

**Pattern Identified**: Strategic Platform Acquisition / Post-Acute EHR Expands to Acute Care

**Why This Classification**:
PointClickCare, the dominant EHR serving 21,000+ skilled nursing facilities, acquired Collective Medical to expand beyond post-acute care into the acute/ambulatory market. This was a strategic expansion play - using Collective Medical's hospital and payer network to create end-to-end care coordination capabilities across the full continuum.

**Evidence**:
- PointClickCare explicitly stated goal to create "largest combined acute and post-acute care network" [2020-12-08](https://pointclickcare.com/press-releases/pointclickcare-technologies-announces-intent-to-acquire-collective-medical-creating-the-largest-combined-acute-and-post-acute-care-network-in-north-america/)
- Companies had existing partnership since August 2019, validating strategic fit
- Acquisition positioned PointClickCare to compete for value-based care contracts requiring full-continuum data

**What's Interesting/Unusual About This Deal**:
- Collective Medical was bootstrapped for 8 years before taking its first (and only) institutional round
- $650M exit on just $47.5M in funding represents exceptional capital efficiency (~14x return)
- COVID-19 pandemic highlighted gaps in care coordination between hospitals and post-acute facilities, validating the thesis
- Regulatory requirement (CMS e-notifications CoP) created guaranteed demand for the solution
- Deal required CFIUS approval due to foreign investment considerations

**Confidence in Classification**: High - Clear strategic expansion by dominant post-acute EHR into acute care market

## Target Company: Collective Medical

### What They Did
Collective Medical built a real-time care coordination network connecting hospitals, ambulatory practices, post-acute providers, and health plans. The platform enabled instant visibility into patient care events (ED visits, admissions, discharges) to support better care decisions and transitions.

**Core Products**:
- **EDIE (Emergency Department Information Exchange)**: Real-time alerts for ED physicians showing patient history across all connected EDs - originally focused on identifying patients seeking opioids
- **PreManage**: Broader care coordination platform for hospitals, post-acute facilities, and health plans to identify and manage high-risk patients
- **Real-time ADT notifications**: Instant alerts when patients experience care events anywhere in the network

**Business Model**: Network-based SaaS platform with subscription fees from hospitals, health systems, post-acute facilities, and health plans

### Scale & Network (at acquisition)
- 1,300+ hospitals connected
- Thousands of ambulatory practices
- Long-term post-acute care (LTPAC) providers
- Every national health plan
- 39-state network coverage
- ACO and value-based care organization connections

### Funding & Investors
| Round | Date | Amount | Lead Investor | Other Investors |
|-------|------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Series A | Nov 2017 | $47.5M | Kleiner Perkins | Bessemer Venture Partners, Maverick Ventures, Kaiser Permanente Ventures, Providence Ventures, Peterson Ventures, Epic Ventures |
| **Total** | | **$47.5M** | | |

**Notable**: Collective Medical was bootstrapped for 8 years before taking any institutional capital - demonstrating product-market fit and capital efficiency.

### The "Crown Jewel"
The network and data assets were the primary value drivers:
- Largest care coordination network connecting acute and post-acute settings
- Real-time data on complex patient populations (substance use disorder, mental health, high utilizers)
- Established relationships with every national health plan
- Regulatory-mandated use case (CMS e-notifications)

### Leadership
- **Chris Klomp**: CEO - later went on to serve on boards of Maven Clinic and Nomi Health, and became CMS Administrator in 2025
- **Wylie van den Akker**: Co-founder
- **Adam Green**: Co-founder

## Acquirer Context: PointClickCare

### Who They Are
PointClickCare is the leading cloud-based healthcare software provider for the senior care industry, serving skilled nursing facilities, senior living communities, and home health agencies. Founded in 2000 and headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.

**Key Stats at Acquisition**:
- 21,000+ skilled nursing facilities, senior living communities, and home health agencies
- 97% of US hospitals discharge patients to SNFs using PointClickCare
- Cloud-based SaaS platform for clinical, financial, and operational management
- Market leader in post-acute EHR

### Why They Bought Collective Medical
**Stated Rationale** [2020-12-08](https://hitconsultant.net/2020/12/08/pointclickcare-acquires-collective-medical/):
- Create largest combined acute and post-acute care network in North America
- Provide care teams with real-time patient insights across the full continuum
- Enable better decision-making and improved clinical outcomes
- Address care coordination gaps highlighted by COVID-19

**CEO Mike Wessinger's Quote**:
"The healthcare ecosystem is a mix of disconnected providers, systems, plans, processes and data. Healthcare costs and risk are on the rise, while patient care and provider-to-provider coordination are inconsistent. Our mission is to improve the lives of seniors, and we believe the best way to meaningfully advance this goal is by connecting disparate points of care."

**Strategic Logic**:
- PointClickCare dominated post-acute but had limited visibility into acute care
- Collective Medical provided the "eyes" into hospitals and EDs
- Combined network enables true full-continuum care coordination
- Positions for value-based care contracts requiring acute-to-post-acute data sharing

### Prior M&A Pattern
PointClickCare had been active acquirer prior to Collective Medical:
- QuickMAR (electronic medication administration)
- Various post-acute care technology acquisitions
- Post-Collective Medical: Acquired Audacious Inquiry in 2022 to expand care coordination network

---

## Strategic Analysis

### Stated Rationale vs. Probable Reality
**What They Said**: "Together, PointClickCare and Collective Medical will provide diverse care teams across the continuum of acute, ambulatory, and post-acute care with point-of-care access to deep, real-time patient insights."

**What the Deal Structure and Timing Suggest**:
- COVID-19 created urgent visibility into care transitions gaps
- CMS e-notifications mandate created guaranteed revenue stream
- Value-based care shift required full-continuum data that neither company had alone
- $650M price reflected strategic necessity, not just financial metrics

### Value Capture Mechanism
1. **Network expansion**: Hospital connections provide upstream visibility for SNF operators
2. **Payer contracts**: Health plans need transitions data for VBC programs
3. **Regulatory compliance**: CMS mandates create recurring revenue
4. **Cross-sell opportunities**: Collective Medical customers introduced to PointClickCare SNF network
5. **Data monetization**: Combined data assets valuable for analytics and risk stratification

### Competitive Implications
- Created dominant player in care transitions technology
- Positioned against CarePort (WellSky) and PatientPing (Bamboo Health)
- Hospital-to-SNF transition data becomes strategic asset
- Health plans increasingly dependent on combined network

- Expanded interoperability capabilities

## Relevance to Dimer Health

**High Relevance**: Collective Medical and Dimer Health address different parts of the same problem:

| Capability | Collective Medical | Dimer Health |
|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Core Function** | Real-time visibility into patient transitions | Post-discharge clinical intervention |
