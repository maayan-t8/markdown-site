# PatientPing -> Appriss Health Acquisition

*Research Completed: January 2026*
*Transaction Status: Closed*

---

## Deal Summary

Appriss Health, a PE-backed behavioral health analytics company, acquired PatientPing, the nation's leading real-time care coordination and ADT (Admission, Discharge, Transfer) notification platform, for approximately $500 million. The combined entity rebranded as Bamboo Health in August 2021, creating the largest real-time care collaboration network in the US focused on whole-person care coordination across physical and behavioral health settings.

This acquisition is highly relevant to Dimer Health as PatientPing pioneered the exact problem Dimer addresses: enabling real-time notifications and care coordination during patient transitions between care settings to prevent readmissions and improve outcomes.

## Exit Scenario Analysis

**Pattern Identified**: PE Platform Roll-Up / Care Coordination Infrastructure Play

**Why This Classification**:
This transaction represents a PE-backed platform (Appriss Health, backed by Clearlake Capital and Insight Partners) acquiring a complementary care coordination technology to build comprehensive "whole-person care" infrastructure. The acquirer was building a portfolio of solutions connecting behavioral health with physical health care coordination.

**Evidence**:
- Clearlake Capital and Insight Partners backed Appriss Health and supported the acquisition [2021-03-23](https://bhbusiness.com/2021/03/23/pe-backed-behavioral-software-company-appriss-health-acquires-patientping-for-a-reported-500m/)
- Post-acquisition rebrand to "Bamboo Health" signaled creation of unified platform [2021-08-31](https://bamboohealth.com/press-release/appriss-health-completes-acquisition-of-patientping/)
- Combined company positioned to connect behavioral and physical health care coordination

**What's Interesting/Unusual About This Deal**:
- PatientPing was already the dominant player in ADT notifications with the largest network in the US
- Regulatory tailwind: CMS mandated e-notifications (ADT sharing) as a Condition of Participation for hospitals, creating guaranteed demand
- COVID-19 pandemic accelerated need for real-time care transitions visibility
- The acquirer (Appriss) was primarily in behavioral health/PDMP space - this expanded their scope to all care transitions

**Confidence in Classification**: High - Clear PE roll-up strategy with platform expansion rationale

## Target Company: PatientPing

### What They Did
PatientPing built the nation's largest real-time care coordination platform connecting hospitals, post-acute facilities, health plans, and ambulatory providers through ADT (Admission, Discharge, Transfer) notifications.

**Core Products**:
- **Pings**: Real-time notifications when patients experience care events (hospital admission, ED visit, discharge, post-acute admission)
- **Callouts**: Patient engagement and program enrollment tools
- **Spotlights**: Real-time network performance dashboards
- **Route**: Hospital e-notifications compliance solution for CMS Condition of Participation

**Business Model**: SaaS platform connecting care teams across the continuum via real-time data sharing

### Scale & Network (at acquisition)
- 1,000+ hospitals connected
- 5,000+ post-acute care facilities
- 135 million patient ADT events processed annually
- 43 million covered lives
- 39-state network coverage
- Connections to every national health plan

### Funding & Investors
| Round | Date | Amount | Lead Investors |
|-------|------|--------|----------------|
| Series C | June 2020 | $60M | Andreessen Horowitz, F-Prime Capital, GV, Transformation Capital |
| Earlier rounds | Pre-2020 | $40M+ | Various |
| **Total Raised** | | **$100M+** | |

### The "Crown Jewel"
The network itself was the primary asset - PatientPing had achieved dominant market position in ADT notifications with connections to more hospitals and PAC facilities than any competitor. The CMS mandate for e-notifications (effective May 2021) created regulatory lock-in for their solution.

**Relevance to Dimer Health**: PatientPing addresses the "when" and "where" of care transitions (real-time alerts about patient movement). Dimer addresses the "what happens next" - the actual clinical care and monitoring post-discharge. These are complementary capabilities in the transitional care ecosystem.

## Acquirer Context: Appriss Health

### Who They Are
Appriss Health was a Louisville, Kentucky-based cloud-based software and analytics company focused on behavioral health and controlled substance monitoring. Their flagship product, NarxCare, provided PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) analytics to help identify patients at risk for substance use disorders.

**Key Stats at Acquisition**:
- Operated PDMP programs in 40+ states
- Provided controlled substance analytics to healthcare providers nationwide
- Backed by Clearlake Capital and Insight Partners

### Why They Bought PatientPing
**Stated Rationale** [2021-05-06](https://bamboohealth.com/press-release/appriss-health-completes-acquisition-of-patientping/):
- Create comprehensive "whole-person care" platform connecting behavioral and physical health
- Leverage PatientPing's network to deliver PDMP insights at point of care
- Enable real-time care collaboration for complex patients including those with substance use disorders

**Unstated Motivations**:
- PatientPing's network represented infrastructure that could distribute Appriss's behavioral health insights
- Regulatory mandates (CMS e-notifications) guaranteed recurring revenue
- Combined network position would be defensible against competitors

### Prior M&A Pattern
- Appriss Health was itself a carve-out from Appriss Inc. (2017)
- PE sponsors (Clearlake, Insight) were actively building the platform through M&A
- Post-PatientPing acquisition, the company rebranded to Bamboo Health and continued acquiring

---

## Strategic Analysis

### Stated Rationale vs. Probable Reality
**What They Said**: "The combined company will leverage its leading cloud-based software and analytics platform to connect nearly one million healthcare professionals and deliver coordinated care across the behavioral health and physical health spectrum."

**What the Deal Structure Suggests**:
- PE sponsors saw opportunity to create dominant care coordination infrastructure
- PatientPing's network was the "rails" on which behavioral health insights could travel
- The $500M price reflected strategic value beyond PatientPing's standalone economics

### Value Capture Mechanism
1. **Network effects**: Larger network = more valuable to all participants
2. **Regulatory compliance revenue**: CMS e-notifications mandate creates recurring demand
3. **Upsell pathway**: Behavioral health analytics layered onto care coordination platform
4. **Health plan contracts**: Payers pay for visibility into member care events

### Competitive Implications
- Acquisition consolidated two previously separate markets (PDMP + ADT notifications)
- Created barriers to entry through network scale
- Positioned Bamboo Health against CarePort (WellSky) in care transitions market

- Products unified under Bamboo Health umbrella
- Continued expansion of both network coverage and product capabilities

### Subsequent Acquisitions
Bamboo Health continued platform expansion post-merger:
- Acquired Audacious Inquiry (connected care platform) in 2022

## Relevance to Dimer Health

**High Relevance**: PatientPing and Dimer Health are complementary solutions in the transitional care ecosystem:

| Capability | PatientPing | Dimer Health |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Core Function** | Real-time notification of care events | Post-discharge clinical care |
| **When Engaged** | At moment of transition | 24-72 hours post-discharge, ongoing |
| **Value Delivered** | Visibility/awareness | Clinical intervention |
| **User** | Care managers, health plans | Patients, referring providers |

**Strategic Implications**:
- PatientPing's $500M exit validates market for care transitions technology
- Regulatory tailwinds (CMS readmission penalties, e-notifications mandate) benefit both companies
- Combined solution (notification + clinical intervention) could be highly valuable
- Potential acquirers: Bamboo Health itself, health systems, payers seeking transitional care capabilities
