# Medalogix + Forcura Merger (Berkshire Partners)

*Research Completed: January 2026*
*Transaction Status: Closed*

---

## Deal Summary

Medalogix, a clinical decision support and predictive analytics company for home health and hospice, merged with Forcura, an intelligent workflow management company, under new ownership by Berkshire Partners. The Vistria Group retained a minority stake. The combined company, valued at approximately $1 billion, rebranded as Mosai in October 2025 and operates as the leading post-acute care technology platform for home-based care providers.

This transaction is highly relevant to Dimer Health as the combined entity focuses on enabling intelligent patient care in the home health/hospice setting, including predictive analytics for patient transitions, risk stratification, and care optimization - capabilities that complement Dimer's transitional care model.

## Exit Scenario Analysis

**Pattern Identified**: PE Platform Combination / Post-Acute Care Roll-Up

**Why This Classification**:
This transaction represents a PE-orchestrated merger of two complementary companies to create a scaled platform in post-acute care technology. Berkshire Partners (PE) acquired both companies and combined them to create a more valuable integrated offering. This is a classic PE "buy and build" strategy.

**Evidence**:
- Berkshire Partners explicitly positioned as "lead investor" and majority owner [2025-03-19](https://berkshirepartners.com/forcura-and-medalogix-join-to-create-transformative-post-acute-care-technology-platform/)
- The Vistria Group (existing Medalogix investor) retained minority stake - indicating continuation of platform-building strategy
- Combined valuation of ~$1B suggests significant value creation through combination
- Quick rebrand to Mosai (October 2025) signals intention to operate as unified platform

**What's Interesting/Unusual About This Deal**:
- Both companies were previously PE-backed: Forcura by Accel-KKR (since 2020), Medalogix by Vistria Group (since 2021)
- The combination creates a "referral to discharge" platform covering the entire home-based care episode
- $1B valuation makes this one of the larger post-acute care technology deals
- Rapid rebrand to Mosai (7 months after merger) shows aggressive integration
- Both companies serve overlapping customer bases (home health, hospice agencies)

**Confidence in Classification**: High - Clear PE platform combination strategy with roll-up characteristics

## Relevance to Dimer Health

**High Relevance**: Medalogix/Forcura (Mosai) and Dimer Health operate in adjacent segments of the post-acute care continuum:

| Capability | Mosai (Medalogix+Forcura) | Dimer Health |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| **Care Setting** | Home health & hospice (ongoing) | Transitional care (immediate post-discharge) |
| **Core Function** | Workflow + predictive analytics | Clinical intervention + monitoring |
| **Timing** | Throughout home health episode | First 30 days post-discharge |
| **Customer** | Home health/hospice agencies | Health systems, surgical practices |
| **Value Delivered** | Operational efficiency, outcomes prediction | Readmission prevention |

**Strategic Implications for Dimer**:
- $1B valuation validates post-acute care technology market
- PE appetite for home-based care technology platforms is strong
- Combined "referral to discharge" capabilities increasingly valuable
- Dimer's "hospital to home" focus complements Mosai's "home health episode" focus
- Potential partnership opportunity: Dimer manages immediate post-discharge, hands off to home health agencies using Mosai
- Potential acquirers: PE firms building post-acute platforms (Berkshire, TPG, etc.)

**Market Observation**: The healthcare value chain from hospital discharge to home recovery is being assembled through M&A - notification (PatientPing/Bamboo), coordination (CarePort/WellSky), home health operations (Mosai), clinical intervention (Dimer opportunity).
