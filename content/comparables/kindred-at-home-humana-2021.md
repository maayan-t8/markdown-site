## Deal Summary

Humana acquired the remaining 60% stake in Kindred at Home (KAH), the nation's largest home health and hospice provider, for approximately $5.7 billion in cash and debt, bringing its total ownership to 100%. The full enterprise value of the transaction was $8.1 billion, reflecting Humana's existing $2.4 billion equity position from its initial 40% investment in 2018. This was Humana's largest acquisition in company history and represented a strategic bet on home-based care as central to value-based care delivery. Following the acquisition, the home health business was rebranded to CenterWell Home Health, while Humana later divested the hospice operations.

## Exit Scenario Analysis

**Pattern Identified**: Payer Vertical Integration / In-Home Care Ownership

This transaction represents the definitive payer vertical integration play in home health. Humana, one of the largest Medicare Advantage insurers, fully integrated the nation's largest home health provider to own the post-acute care delivery infrastructure for its members. This was not a technology or platform acquisition - it was direct ownership of care delivery assets at massive scale.

**Why This Classification**:
Humana explicitly stated the acquisition was about accelerating value-based models, aligning incentives, and controlling the care delivery experience for their members. By owning Kindred at Home, Humana could directly manage post-discharge care rather than contracting with third-party providers, enabling tighter integration between insurance and care delivery.

**Evidence**:
- Humana CEO Bruce Broussard stated [2021-04-27](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-announces-agreement-acquire-remaining-60-percent-interest): "Fully integrating Kindred at Home will enable us to more closely align incentives to focus on improving patient outcomes and on reducing the total cost of care"
- The deal was positioned as "critical to deploying at scale a value-based, advanced home health model"
- 65% geographic overlap with Humana's MA membership - clear intent to serve own members
- Humana had already proven the model works through its 40% ownership, increasing penetration from 8% to 19% of Humana episodes [2021-04-27](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-announces-agreement-acquire-remaining-60-percent-interest)
- Outcomes included "reduced hospitalizations, readmissions, and ER utilization"

**What's Interesting/Unusual About This Deal**:
1. **"Test before you buy"**: Humana first invested 40% in 2018, spent 3 years proving the model, then fully acquired - a deliberate de-risking approach
2. **Hospice spin-off**: Unlike the home health business, Humana announced plans to divest hospice to a minority stake, eventually selling to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice
3. **Massive value creation for PE sellers**: TPG and WCAS invested in 2018 at a much lower valuation; by 2021, Humana paid $8.1B EV - substantial returns
4. **CenterWell rebranding**: Home health was rebranded to CenterWell Home Health, signaling integration into Humana's broader healthcare services brand
5. **Payer-agnostic positioning**: Despite being owned by Humana, KAH/CenterWell serves non-Humana patients - maintaining market share while prioritizing Humana members

**Confidence in Classification**: High - This is the clearest example of payer vertical integration in home health, with explicit strategic rationale and documented outcomes.

2. **Geographic alignment**: 65% overlap with Humana MA membership - natural integration opportunity
3. **Proven outcomes**: "Reduced hospitalizations, readmissions, and ER utilization" during Humana's partial ownership
4. **Value-based care capability**: Experience operating under outcome-based rather than volume-based incentives
5. **Brand and infrastructure**: Established patient relationships and operational infrastructure across 40 states

## Acquirer Context

### Who They Are

Humana Inc. is one of the largest health insurance companies in the United States, with particular strength in Medicare Advantage. At the time of acquisition, Humana was executing a strategy to integrate insurance with care delivery through its "Home Solutions" business.

**Scale (at acquisition)**:
- ~$80B annual revenue (2020)
- ~20M+ members across insurance products
- Leading Medicare Advantage insurer
- Growing healthcare services footprint

### Why They Bought This

**Stated Rationale** [2021-04-27](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-announces-agreement-acquire-remaining-60-percent-interest):
> "We continue to invest in assets that allow Humana to better manage the holistic needs of our members and patients by expanding care in the home, including primary care, telehealth, and emergency room care, while also addressing social determinants of health." - Bruce D. Broussard, President and CEO

> "Fully integrating Kindred at Home will enable us to more closely align incentives to focus on improving patient outcomes and on reducing the total cost of care. This is critical to deploying at scale a value-based, advanced home health model." - Bruce D. Broussard

**Segment President Susan Diamond** [2021-04-27](https://humana.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humana-announces-agreement-acquire-remaining-60-percent-interest):
> "Our work with Kindred at Home allowed us to learn more about the advanced clinical models needed, proved that we can execute on the needed innovation, demonstrated that we can drive penetration and gave us confidence we can support a higher acuity patient by leveraging the other home-based assets and capabilities we've assembled."

**Strategic Logic**:
1. **Incentive alignment**: Own care delivery to fully align with value-based outcomes
2. **Total cost of care control**: Manage post-acute spend directly rather than through third parties
3. **Member experience**: Control quality and coordination of post-discharge care
4. **Proven model**: 3 years of partial ownership demonstrated outcomes (penetration growth, reduced readmissions)
5. **Medicare Advantage advantage**: Home health is critical for MA plan performance and Star ratings

### Prior M&A Pattern (Humana Home-Based Care Focus)

Humana has assembled a comprehensive home-based care portfolio:
- **Primary care at home**: Various initiatives and partnerships
- **Telehealth**: Multiple investments in virtual care
- **Home health**: Kindred at Home (now CenterWell Home Health)
- **Post-acute coordination**: Analytics and care management capabilities

The KAH acquisition was Humana's largest single investment in the home-based care thesis.

## Strategic Analysis

### Stated Rationale vs. Probable Reality

**Stated**: Improve outcomes, reduce total cost of care, deploy value-based models at scale

**Probable Reality**:
1. **Medical loss ratio improvement**: By owning home health, Humana can deliver post-acute care at lower cost than external providers, improving MLR
2. **Competitive differentiation**: With 65% geographic overlap, Humana can offer differentiated home health access to MA members
3. **Network steerage**: Preference own home health services for Humana members, reducing dependence on competitors
4. **Data integration**: Combine claims data with clinical data for better care management
5. **Scale economics**: 43,000 caregivers represent significant labor market power

### Value Capture Mechanism

Humana's thesis for value creation:
1. **Internal margin capture**: Move external home health spend to owned operations
2. **Reduced hospitalizations**: Better home health reduces costly readmissions
3. **MA Star ratings**: Quality metrics improve with integrated care
4. **Member retention**: Better post-acute experience improves member satisfaction and retention
5. **Payer-agnostic revenue**: Continue serving non-Humana patients for revenue diversification

### Demonstrated Results (Pre-Full Acquisition)

During the 40% ownership period (2018-2021):
- Humana member penetration: Grew from 8% to 19% of applicable episodes
- Outcomes: "Reduced hospitalizations, readmissions, and ER utilization"
- These results gave Humana confidence to fully acquire

### Competitive Implications

This deal triggered an industry-wide payer consolidation race:
- **UnitedHealth response**: Acquired LHC Group for $5.4B in 2023, bid for Amedisys
- **CVS response**: Acquired Signify Health for $8B in 2022
- **Walgreens response**: Acquired CareCentrix for $722M in 2022
- **Industry effect**: Major payers now control largest home health assets

### Post-Deal Developments

**CenterWell Rebranding** [2022-03](https://cepr.net/publications/preying-on-the-dying-private-equity-gets-rich-in-hospice-care/):
- Kindred at Home rebranded to CenterWell Home Health
- Integrated into Humana's healthcare services brand family

**Hospice Divestiture**:
- Humana announced intent to divest hospice/community care operations
- Retained minority interest
- Sold majority to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice
- Rationale: Home health more critical to VBC; hospice better suited for partnership model

## Relevance to Dimer Health

### Similarities

| Dimension | Kindred at Home | Dimer Health |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Mission | Post-acute care in the home | Post-discharge transitional care |
| Outcomes Focus | Reduced readmissions, hospitalizations, ER visits | 67% reduction in readmissions |
| Payer Alignment | VBC and MA-focused | VBC and CMS penalty alignment |
| Member Serving | 550,000+ patients annually | Growing health system partnerships |
| Geographic Scale | 40 states | 5 states (expanding) |

### Key Differences

| Dimension | Kindred at Home | Dimer Health |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Scale | $3B revenue, 43,000 employees | ~$7.8M revenue, ~42 employees |
| Delivery Model | Physical in-home visits | Virtual-first (telehealth + AI) |
| Care Model | Traditional home health (nursing, therapy) | Physician-led transitional care |
| Asset Intensity | High (massive workforce) | Low (virtual platform) |
| Market Position | #1 in U.S. | Emerging category creator |

### Implications for Dimer

1. **Payer interest validated**: Humana paid $8.1B EV (~2.7x revenue) for home health with outcomes - validates payer appetite for care transitions
2. **Outcomes matter**: Humana explicitly cited "reduced hospitalizations, readmissions, and ER utilization" as decision factors - Dimer's 67% readmission reduction is comparable
3. **Test before buy model**: Humana's 3-year partial ownership before full acquisition suggests payers may prefer to prove integration before large commitments
4. **Virtual complement opportunity**: Dimer's virtual model could complement a physical home health provider like CenterWell by adding transitional care layer
5. **Scale is destiny**: The massive scale of Kindred ($3B, 43K employees) commanded premium valuation - Dimer would need to demonstrate path to scale
6. **Strategic value**: 2.7x revenue multiple for home health services suggests premium available for strategic fit with payer
