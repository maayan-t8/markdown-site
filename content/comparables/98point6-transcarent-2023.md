*Research Completed: 2026-01-03*
*Transaction Status: Closed*

---

## Deal Summary

Transcarent acquired 98point6's AI-powered virtual care platform and primary care business for $100 million in March 2023. This deal represents a distressed acquisition of a once highly-valued AI-enabled telehealth company that had raised $247 million but struggled with unit economics. Transcarent, led by Livongo co-founder Glen Tullman, acquired the technology and provider network to add text-based AI virtual care as the front door to its employer health benefits platform.

## Exit Scenario Analysis

**Pattern Identified**: Distressed Platform Acquisition / AI Technology Acqui-hire

**Why This Classification**:
This deal represents a distressed exit where a well-funded digital health company with strong technology but unsustainable unit economics was acquired at a significant discount to total capital raised. The buyer (Transcarent) was primarily interested in the AI technology platform and affiliated provider network, not the standalone business. The deal structure (partial acquisition with the remaining company pivoting to software licensing) confirms the distressed nature.

**Evidence**:
- 98point6 raised $247M but sold for $100M [2020-10-15](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/goldman-sachs-backed-98point6-banks-118m-funding-to-expand-virtual-primary-care) and [2023-03-06](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/transcarent-acquires-98point6-telehealth-for-100m/644255/)
- Company was "losing 60 cents for every dollar of revenue" [2025-02-13](https://medcitynews.com/2025/02/is-glen-tullman-a-hypocrite-or-a-victim-of-the-system-he-aimed-to-disrupt/)
- Post-acquisition, 98point6 pivoted to software licensing only ("98point6 Technologies") [2023-03-06](https://www.geekwire.com/2023/seattle-healthcare-startup-98point6-selling-part-of-its-business-for-100m-to-transcarent/)
- Deal was combination of cash and equity with performance targets [2023-03-06](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/transcarent-acquires-98point6-telehealth-for-100m/644255/)

**What's Interesting/Unusual About This Deal**:
1. **Significant value destruction**: $247M raised, sold for $100M (60% capital loss for investors)
2. **Partial acquisition structure**: Transcarent bought the care business; 98point6 retained the technology licensing business
3. **Strategic buyer with deep pockets**: Glen Tullman (Livongo founder) acquiring AI capabilities to compete with his former company (now part of Teladoc)
4. **AI as the crown jewel**: The text-based AI platform was the primary value driver, not the clinical services business

**Confidence in Classification**: High - Multiple sources confirm distressed nature

## Target Company

### What They Did
98point6 was an AI-powered, text-based virtual primary care platform. Patients could access on-demand care through a mobile app, starting with an AI chatbot that gathered symptoms and history before connecting to a physician for diagnosis and treatment via text.

**Key Differentiators**:
- Text-first (not video) virtual care model
- AI-powered intake and triage (5+ years of AI development)
- On-demand access (no appointment needed)
- Primary care focus (not urgent care)

### Business Model
- B2B2C: Sold to employers, health plans, and health systems
- Per-member-per-month (PMPM) pricing
- Covered employees/members accessed care at no cost

### Scale at Acquisition
- 3+ million covered lives [2023-03-06](https://transcarent.com/press-releases/transcarent-to-acquire-98point6-ai-powered-virtual-care-platform-and-care)
- 240+ commercial partnerships [2020-10-15](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/98point6-announces-118-million-series-e-led-by-l-catterton-and-activant-capital-to-support-rapid-growth-301152981.html)
- Major clients: Boeing, Banner|Aetna, Circle K, Red Bull, Sam's Club, Costco, Chipotle
- Estimated revenue: ~$25M [Low confidence - ZoomInfo estimate]
- Significant losses: ~60% of revenue [2025-02-13](https://medcitynews.com/2025/02/is-glen-tullman-a-hypocrite-or-a-victim-of-the-system-he-aimed-to-disrupt/)

### The "Crown Jewel"
The AI-powered text-based care platform with 5+ years of training data. Glen Tullman stated: "98point6 has been at it for four or five years. So we're able to acquire this technology and have a three or four or five year head start on everybody else."

## Acquirer Context

### Who They Are
Transcarent is a health and care experience company founded by Glen Tullman (former CEO of Allscripts, co-founder of Livongo). The company provides a consumer-facing platform for self-insured employers that integrates virtual care, pharmacy, surgery, and specialty care navigation.

**Key Stats**:
- Founded: 2020
- Headquarters: Palo Alto, CA
- Total Funding: $450M+ (as of May 2024)
- Valuation: $2.2B [2024-05-02](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/transcarent-raises-126m-bringing-its-valuation-22b)
- CEO: Glen Tullman (Livongo co-founder)

### Why They Bought This
**Stated Rationale** (from press release [2023-03-06](https://transcarent.com/press-releases/transcarent-to-acquire-98point6-ai-powered-virtual-care-platform-and-care)):
- "Leveraging AI to drive personalization and access to care will revolutionize the virtual care experience"
- "Combining best in class technology with human touch"
- Control the "front door" experience for members

**Probable Reality**:
1. **AI capability gap**: Transcarent needed proprietary AI for text-based care; 98point6 had 5+ years head start
2. **First-touch control**: Tullman stated "how you start determines where you end up" - controlling initial member contact is strategically critical [2023-03-07](https://medcitynews.com/2023/03/transcarent-to-acquire-98point6-for-100m-gain-ai-powered-virtual-care-platform/)
3. **Opportunistic pricing**: Acquired AI platform at significant discount to development cost
4. **Client base**: Gained immediate access to Boeing, Banner|Aetna, and other major employers

### Prior M&A Pattern
- 98point6 was Transcarent's first major acquisition
- Subsequently acquired Accolade for $621M in 2025 [2025-01-08](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/transcarent-acquire-accolade-621-million-health-benefits-navigation/736798/)

## Strategic Analysis

### Stated Rationale vs. Probable Reality
| Stated | Probable Reality |
|--------|------------------|
| "Revolutionize virtual care with AI" | Acquire AI capabilities that would take 5+ years to build |
| "Best in class technology with human touch" | Control the front-door member experience |
| "Easy access to comprehensive platform" | Upsell 98point6 clients to full Transcarent suite |

### Value Capture Mechanism
1. **Technology integration**: Embed 98point6 AI as front door to Transcarent platform
2. **Client cross-sell**: Convert 98point6 employer clients to full Transcarent relationships
3. **Physician leverage**: Use affiliated medical group across Transcarent services
4. **Cost structure improvement**: Transcarent's platform economics may improve 98point6's unit economics

### Relevance to Dimer Health
**High relevance** - This deal demonstrates:
1. **AI-powered virtual care is valued**: Even in distress, the AI platform commanded $100M
2. **Unit economics matter**: Despite strong technology and growth, 98point6 couldn't achieve profitability
3. **Strategic buyers pay for capability**: Transcarent paid for 5 years of AI development time
4. **Text-based care model**: Similar to Dimer's AI companion (AiME), text/chat interfaces are valued
5. **Employer/payer channel**: B2B2C model similar to Dimer's health system partnerships

**Key Differences from Dimer**:
- 98point6 was primary care; Dimer is transitional/post-discharge care
- 98point6 was on-demand; Dimer is proactive outreach
- 98point6 had poor unit economics; Dimer's outcomes-based model may have better economics
- Dimer has proven clinical outcomes (67% readmission reduction)

## Post-Deal Outcomes

- 98point6 Technologies (remaining entity) raised $30.7M in 2023 to focus on software licensing [Accessed 2026-01-03](https://www.98point6.com/newsroom/press-coverage/)
- Transcarent integrated 98point6's AI as front-end to its platform
- Transcarent subsequently acquired Accolade ($621M, 2025), continuing consolidation strategy
